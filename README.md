# Code_Meets_Art_23110128

This is my submission for the Code Meets Art competition held by the Coding Club of IITGN. 

The Image is a Low-Poly Art version of the Lal Minar with the Northern Lights in the background and fractal snowflakes falling. 

I used OpenCV to change the background to the Northern Lights, converted the image to Low-Poly Art, and added the fractal snow.

This image represents one of my favorite places on campus and my wish to see the northern lights and snowflakes on campus. It would be a breathtaking view. 
On a deeper note, it also represents miracles that might change your perspective, and we should see things differently. This is a place where miracles happen.
